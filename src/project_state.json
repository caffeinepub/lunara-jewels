    "Chatbot must be implemented as an internal, rule-based FAQ-style assistant (no external AI/chat services integration).",

    "Adding generic e-commerce pages (certifications, payment methods, order tracking/accounts) risks implying unsupported capabilities; content and UI must be carefully constrained to Lunara Jewels’ actual inquiry-based process and available assurances.",
